# Parallelism, Concurrency and Scheduling in JavaScript

## History

In the beginning there was no software only hardware

## Concepts

Process

Threads

Fibers / Co-routings

Event loop ticks

Parallelism

Concurrency

Sequential vs Parallel execution

Call stack vs Async stack

Shared vs Isolated memory

Cooperative vs Preemptive scheduling


Isolation - avoid cascading failure
Communication - avoid race conditions




Event loop
- Blocking
- Data Races



history
 - batch processing / single program computers
 - mainframes / multi-user systems - process level scheduling blocking I/O
 - multi-core systems / hardware threading
